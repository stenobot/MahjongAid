# Mahjong Aid
An app that tracks ongoing Mahjong games, calculates scores for each round, and teaches you how to play!

This is a Windows 10 universal app, built in C# and XAML. You can read about how I built this app here:

The app will keep track of your game info.

If you pick up the same game later, just load the save data!
