# Mahjong Aid
Mahjong Aid is an app that tracks ongoing Mahjong games, calculates scores for each round, and teaches you how to play!

This is a Windows 10 universal app, built in C# and XAML. It works great across phone and desktop, and it's available today for free in the Windows Store. You can read about how I built this app here:
